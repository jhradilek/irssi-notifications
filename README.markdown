## Description

Irssi looks for additional scrips in the in the **~/.irssi/scripts/** directory. To make sure that this directory exists, type the following at a shell prompt:

    install -d ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/

To install the **notifications** script, change to the directory with your local copy of the repository and type:

    cp notifications.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/

    ln -s ../notifications.pl

The script is loaded the next time you start the client.
